# OCB Sun Dial Mod - 7 Days to Die (V1.0 exp) Addon

Small Harmony (Non-EAC) Mod adding a working sun dial.

[![GitHub CI Compile Status][3]][2]

## Overhaul compatibility

This mod was designed with Overhauls in mind that hide the main clock
from the player UI. In order to make this mod compatible with most of
them, I tried to keep the recipes simple while still having it locked
behind some basic requirements. It also works well together with my
analog clocks mod, which can be built at a later stage.
